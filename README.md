# Disaster-Response-Pipelines

This is my repository containing all project files for the Disaster-Response-Pipeline.

# Motivation

I've used data from Figure Eight to develop and establish a machine learning algorithm to classify textual data. This machine learning algorith 
can predict entered messeages in a web application and identify the relevant categories. To realize the machine learning algorithm i've used several notesbooks in Jupyter:

[1] ETL Pipeline Preparation
[2] ML Pipeline Preparation
[3] train_classifier.py
[4] process_data.py
[5] run.py

# How does the app work?
